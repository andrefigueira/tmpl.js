tmpl.js

Super simple jQuery templating

tmpl.js is for simple jQuery templating, ever had to do:

`html += '<div class="somthing"> ' + something + '</div>';`

Can get real messy real quick right? I wrote this simple jQuery plugin, This is by no means a complete templating system. This is just something simple that can be built upon. But it gets a basic job done and for many that's all that's needed.
